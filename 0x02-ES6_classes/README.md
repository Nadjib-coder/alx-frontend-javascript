## Introduction
This project is focused on ES6 classes, a new syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance in JavaScript. ES6 classes provide a much simpler and clearer syntax to create and manage objects and their prototypes.

## Features
- Define classes using the `class` keyword
- Constructor methods for initializing objects
- Instance methods and properties
- Static methods and properties
- Inheritance using the `extends` keyword
- Superclass method calls using the `super` keyword

## Installation
To use the code in this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/es6-classes-project.git
cd es6-classes-project
```

## Usage
You can run the JavaScript files using Node.js or include them in your web project. Here is an example of how to define and use a class:
```javascript
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a noise.`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} barks.`);
    }
}

const dog = new Dog('Rex');
dog.speak(); // Rex barks.
```
